<p>
The First International Conference on Software Archaeology will be held on the 31st January 2014, at the Museum of London.
</p>
<p>We came up with the name as a bit of a joke, but then everyone said
it sounded like an interesting subject, and we were persuaded to
organise a conference. We hope you like it.</p>
<p>
Our focus is on what we can learn about our present by digging up the bones of old code, and techniques for bringing ancient code back to life. We are still finalising the <a href="sessions.html">programme</a>, but our speakers include <a href="sessions.html#keith">Keith Braithwaite</a>, <a href="sessions.html#daniel">Daniel Brolund</a>, <a href="sessions.html#stephane">Stephane Ducasse</a>, <a href="sessions.html#dmitry">Dmitry Kandalov</a>, <a href="sessions.html#michael">Michael Feathers</a>, <a href="sessions.html#robert">Robert Smallshire</a> and <a href="sessions.html#matt">Matt Wynne</a>. There will be plenty of opportunity to share your experiences too.
</p>
